    <h3>♫Game Play♫</h3> 
    <p>Phantom of The Opera is a point and click styled game for the Nintendo Switch but can also be played on PC and mobile devices. To tell the story of the Phantom of The Opera, the game changes characters, the most frequent one being Christine. There are minigames and puzzles to solve in order to open secret doors and items. The game provides an amazing OST and music from famous operas like “Ah, je ris de me voir” from Faust.</p>

    <p>For the purpose of this study, I will focus on the music aspects of the game and how it affects the gameplay.</p> 
    
    <h3>♫Music♫</h3>

    <h4>♪Don Juan Triumphant♪</h4>
    <p>Similarly to the original novel, Phantom of the Opera by MazM includes the opera Erik wrote, Don Juan Triumphant. After Christine gets kidnapped by Erik, she converses with him about the music sheets on his pipe organ and asks him to play for her. Erik tells her that she can't listen to his opera because it will overpower any human. However, this song serves as the title screen music, which is a little paradoxal.</p>

        <iframe width="300" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZMHusnqbAc?si=JPbLmsfHZzfO3eHD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    
    <p>There are also multiple songs that play during general scenes in the game. These songs, while repetative, set the mood for the opera house and game.</p>
    
    <h5>♪The Ghost Appears♪</h5>
    <p>When Erik appears to Christine for the first time, this song plays. It also plays every time the Phantom appears to Christine. The way the violin goes from quiet to very loud, creates a startling jumpscare for the player. The eeriness of the song enhances the fear that is associated with Erik’s presence.</p>
    
   <div class="video-container">
        <iframe width="300" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taAT0TVJIm4?si=_8DS2AOqIwlyiH3y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    
    <h6>♪Requiem♪</h6>
    <p>In the last chapter of the game, this song can be heard multiple times. By this point in the game, Erik sees Christine as a demon but still wants her by his side. The song is melancholy and depressing. The use of the organ, the instrument Erik is known for, powerfully reflects his emotions. Erik wants to be with Christine, but Christine has already shown she will stop at nothing to leave him and make sure he knows she doesn't love him.</p>

    </div>

    <h7>♪Beau Théâtre♪</h7>
    <p>This song plays while any of the characters are inside the opera house. It has the classic fancy vibe to it, something that would play during a ballroom scene in a movie. It sets the tone for the opera house to be a place where high class people come in and enjoy opera.</p>

    <h8>♪Sinking Down♪</h8>
    <p>This is the song used the most when a depressing situation happens. It plays even when changing rooms, so it gives off a feeling of sadness that follows you no matter where you go.</p>
